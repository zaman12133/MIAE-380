The objective of our project was to develop a portable pedal exerciser suitable for individuals diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). EDS is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin fragility, and other musculoskeletal issues. Traditional exercise equipment may not be suitable for EDS patients due to their physical limitations. Therefore, our proposed pedal exerciser aims to address these challenges by providing a safe, effective, and convenient solution for maintaining joint health and overall fitness.
